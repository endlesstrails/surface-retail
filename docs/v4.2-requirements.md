# v4.2 updates

I have submitted the project on the other end to get the import work correct, so we need to start you working on this.  We will want you to copy the value in field 14 (the value is 35.00 in the attached sample UPC output file for each record) to the end of each record.  If you need the original output file sent to see what you start with let us know and I can send.
 
Somehow we will also need to get this on to Andrea’s PC in a “test” environment as she will have to continue running the old program until the work on the other side is done.
